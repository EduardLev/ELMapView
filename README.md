Turn To Tech Map Project

This project is the 5th project in the Turn To Tech project base.

Directions were to recreate a simple maps app with a segmented controller that switches between standard / hybrid
and satellite views of a map. Added functionality to search for locations & add their pins to the map.
The user location is tracked as the user moves around. Clicking on some pins takes you to their 
websites, which are hard-coded.
